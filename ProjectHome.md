SURE Features provide an interest point detector and a descriptor including surface an color information for RGB-D point clouds.

The source code is online and accessible via Subversion.
Please note that major changes were made in version 0.3 and have not been tested thoroughly. The previous (and better tested) version 0.2.7 is still available under tags.

Installation instructions are contained in the README.TXT.
